      <p>My name is Matthew and I am looking forward to a career as a web developer where I can apply my skills finding solutions that create meaningful and memorable user experiences.  Since my first exposure to the digital world many years ago, I have always been fascinated with the rapid pace of technology advances, and how technology changes our lives….for better or for worse.  I am keen to understand how technology works “under the hood”.  Closing the gap between knowing and not knowing what I don’t know richly satisfies me.</p>

      <p>I have a significant portfolio of knowledge around coaching and training.  I am big believer in developing people to make operations run more efficiently.  Problem solving with a strategic and tactical approach is a skill I used.  Asking questions and active listening have been an invaluable asset to getting the job done and forging strong relationships.</p>
